### Downloading NQC ISOs

We make and host snapshot ISOs every Monday at 12am (GMT). This allows developers to easily access and try out the latest features and updates as soon as they become available. However, please note that these snapshots may not be stable or recommended for production use. In addition, we also create and host ISOs for every substantial release, which include major updates and new features that have undergone extensive testing and verification. 

However, if you're already running an installed version of NQC and want to update to the latest version, you don't necessarily need to reinstall the system using the latest ISO. Instead, you can simply pull the latest codebase from /usr/src and build the kernel and world from there. This allows you to update to the latest version without having to reinstall the entire operating system, saving you time and effort.

To get started, simply visit the Downloads tab and download the latest release/snapshot.
