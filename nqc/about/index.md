# What is NQC?

NQC is an open-source operating system that forms as the bedrock for our cutting-edge OS, Enso.

We are dedicated to redefining the very essence of what an operating system can be. NQC's foundation is built upon the rock-solid FreeBSD, but we've gone to great lengths to imbue it with major changes, security additions, and unparalleled performance enhancements.

One of the core components of the NQC kernel architecture is its modular design, which allows developers to customize and optimize the kernel to suit their specific needs. This modular approach also makes it easier to isolate and fix bugs, as well as add new features.

In addition to its modular design, NQC also includes a range of advanced features that contribute to its overall performance and reliability. For example, it includes a memory protection feature that prevents unauthorized access to system memory, which is essential for security. NQC also includes support for Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP), which enables multiple processors to work together to increase system performance.

NQC also includes a range of tools that make it easier for developers to work with the system. For example, it includes the FreeBSD Ports Collection, which is a comprehensive collection of software packages that can be installed and managed easily.

Other tools available in NQC include DTrace, which is a dynamic tracing framework that can be used to troubleshoot and optimize system performance. It also includes the OpenSSH protocol, which is an essential tool for secure remote access and administration.

In summary, NQC is built on top of the FreeBSD kernel architecture and includes a range of advanced features and tools. Its modular design and range of features make it a powerful and flexible operating system that can be customized to meet the needs of developers and users alike.
