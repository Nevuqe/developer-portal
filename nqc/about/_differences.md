### Differences between NQC and FreeBSD

NQC is a powerful open-source operating system that is built upon the foundations of FreeBSD but with significant improvements and enhancements. We have removed support for legacy architectures, such as ARM-32bit, PowerPC, IA-32, and x86, to focus on optimizing and improving the operating system for modern hardware architectures.

We take security very seriously, and we've implemented a range of patches and enhancements to make NQC a highly foundation. Ranging from smaller changes like encrypted swap, and the automatic cleaning of /tmp, to larger and more impactful changes such as the numerous changes to OpenSSH and the PF firewall. We've removed unnecessary system components (such as sendmail) and disabled as much avoidable background activity as possible to further enhance security.

In terms of performance, we've optimized NQC to boot faster and run more efficiently on modern hardware. We have made numerous improvements to graphics drivers, paging, and SMP to improve overall performance. We've also worked to reduce the number of packages and bloat in the system, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient bedrock operating system.
