### Open Source

One of the greatest advantages of NQC being an open-source operating system is the ability for anyone to contribute to its development. We believe that the power of collaboration and the diversity of ideas can create an operating system that is truly exceptional. 

By providing open access to our source code on platforms like GitHub, we invite developers and users to join our community, and to participate in the development of NQC.

At Nevuqe, we believe that open-source is the way forward for the future of computing, and we're proud to be at the forefront of this movement. We strongly believe that open-sourcing a project can greatly enhance its security. By making our code available to the public, we invite others to look at our work and identify vulnerabilities that may have been overlooked. With more eyes on our code, we can detect and fix issues more quickly and effectively, reducing the amount of software vulnerabilities and improving project security.
