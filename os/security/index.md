# Security

### Our security process

Nevuqe prioritizes the security of our community and products. As such, we follow a strict security process and do not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until our investigation is complete and necessary updates are available.

After addressing security vulnerabilities, Nevuqe will begin documenting them.

We welcome reports from everyone, including security researchers, developers, and users. Please include the specific project and software version(s) you believe are affected, a detailed description of the observed behavior, expected behavior, and a numbered list of steps required to reproduce the issue and/or a video demonstration, if the steps may be hard to follow.

Please use [Nevuqe’s PGP key](../keys/signing-key.asc) to encrypt sensitive information that you send by email.
