### Security Process

For the protection of our community and products, Uquinix doesn't disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until our investigation is complete and any necessary updates are generally available.

Uquinix will begin documenting security vulnerabilities after patching.

### Reporting a security or privacy vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security or privacy vulnerability in a Uquinix project, please report it to us.
We welcome reports from everyone, including security researchers, developers, and users.

To report a security or privacy vulnerability, please send an email to [security@uquinix.com](mailto:security@uquinix.com) that includes:

* The specific project and software version(s) which you believe are affected
* A description of the behavior you observed as well as the behavior that you expected
* A numbered list of steps required to reproduce the issue and/or a video demonstration, if the steps may be hard to follow

Please use [Uquinix's PGP key]({{site.url}}/keys/signing-key.asc) to encrypt sensitive information that you send by email.

You'll receive an email reply from Uquinix to acknowledge that we received your report, and that weâ€™ll contact you if we need more information.
