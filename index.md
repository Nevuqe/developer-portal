# Welcome to UQK

Welcome to UQK. Together, we are working to build a kernel to power and transform the way we use a computer. Our aim is to create a kernel which provides security, performance and compatibility to people who require it.

UQK is created for uqOS, which inspires creativity through its simplistic interface - providing privacy along with a stunning user interface.  For us, transparency is important; that's why UQK is open-source to the public.

We believe open-sourcing improves security, reduces vulnerabilities and brings our community closer. That's why our documentation for UQK is easily accessible to the public.

Please note, this website is under construction - information is being added as UQK progresses.
