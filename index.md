# Welcome to Seva

Welcome to Seva. Together, we are working to build a kernel to power and transform the way we use a computer. Our aim is to create a kernel which provides security, performance and compatibility to people who require it.

Seva is created for the Enso operating system, which inspires through its simplistic interface - providing privacy along with a stunning user interface.  For us, transparency is important; that's why Seva is open-source to the public.

We believe open-sourcing improves security, reduces vulnerabilities and brings our community closer. That's why our documentation for Seva is easily accessible to the public.

Please note, this website is under construction - information is being added as Seva progresses.
