# Welcome to UQC

Welcome to UQC. Together, we are working to build a kernel to power and transform the way we use a computer. Our aim is to create a kernel which provides security, performance and compatibility to people who require it.

UQC is created for Enso, which inspires creativity through its simplistic interface - providing privacy along with a stunning user interface.  For us, transparency is important; that's why UQC is open-source to the public.

We believe open-sourcing improves security, reduces vulnerabilities and brings our community closer. That's why our documentation for UQC is easily accessible to the public.

Please note, this website is under construction - information is being added as UQC progresses.
