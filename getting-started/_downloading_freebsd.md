# Downloading FreeBSD

Now that we have installed UTM, we can download FreeBSD 13 from a verified source. 

[Direct Link](https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/ISO-IMAGES/13.0/FreeBSD-13.0-RELEASE-amd64-dvd1.iso)

~~~ shell
$ wget https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/ISO-IMAGES/13.0/FreeBSD-13.0-RELEASE-amd64-dvd1.iso
~~~

This may take a while depending on your internet speed, if you have a stable internet connection and want to reduce the download size - you can install the bootonly installer. Which downloads required files from the internet upon installation.
