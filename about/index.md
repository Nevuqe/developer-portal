title: About UQC
---

UQC is a groundbreaking new kernel which utilizes elements of the FreeBSD kernel to provide a stunningly smooth user experience. It provides a singular UI toolkit and amazing speed to the user.

### Features

UQC is established on the foundations and framework of FreeBSD, delivering superb stability and support with applications and services.

To improve, we have introduced modern programming principles and beliefs into UQC. We have kept a minimalistic design attitude toward our code. Therefore decreasing the number of files, services and drivers included in the base kernel - diminishing space and expanding the amount of free memory and drive space for more important tasks.

The features of UQC are designed to work together to create a powerful kernel. Some additional features of UQC include:

* Security over Linux/XNU/Windows
* High Performance and Reliability
* Extensive Hardware Compatibility
* Compatibility of Software (40,000+ Ported Software)
* Binary Compatibility with Linux

### Security & Privacy

We have fixed numerous critical vulnerabilities, which can be found [here](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-6/Freebsd.html), and have improved how drivers are loaded and unloaded. We have also removed legacy drivers from the kernel, as in the present they are unnecessary and can be downloaded after installation.

We have also improved many security vulnerabilities based in FreeBSD-Current (14.0), among more.
