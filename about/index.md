title: About UQC
---

UQC utilizes elements of FreeBSD to provide a stunningly smooth user experience. UQC provides incredible performance, alongside refined security to the user.

### Inital Details

UQC is established on the foundations and framework of FreeBSD, delivering incredible stability and support with applications and services.

To improve upon this base, we have introduced modern programming principles and beliefs into UQC. We have kept a minimalistic design attitude toward our code. Therefore decreasing the number of files, services and drivers included in the base system - extending space and expanding the amount of free memory and drive space on the system.

The features of UQC are designed to work together to create a powerful framework for a groundbreaking operating system. Main features of UQC include:

* Security over Linux/XNU/Windows/FreeBSD-Current
* High Performance and Reliability
* Extensive Hardware Compatibility
* Compatibility of Software (40,000+ Ported Software)
* Binary Compatibility with Linux

### Security & Privacy

We strongly reinforce security into our development process, which is why we've made many changes to how UQC operates. FreeBSD, at the time of writing, has many security vulnerabilites which are the result of performance over security. We have subsequently removed these vulnerabilities, without trading off on performance. We have also removed legacy drivers and architectures from the kernel, as these are unnecessary to the vast majority of users, and wouldn't be capable of running on Enso.
